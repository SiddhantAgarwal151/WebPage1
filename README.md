# WebPage1

This is a deployable webpage that is the first webpage I have ever made. It is designed to take in a name and greet the person using the webpage. But, I also designed it to use Auth0 to authenticate the webpage with a password to get into the app. Also, I have used Amazon S3 bucket to store files.
